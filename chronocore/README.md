# **ChronoCore™ — Narrative Spacetime Engine v0.2**  
### *A Physics Kernel for Story Simulation*

**ChronoCore™** is the world’s first **narrative spacetime engine** — a physics-based kernel that models stories the way general relativity models gravity. Using emotional mass, entanglement tensors, quantum motif states, and geodesic character trajectories, ChronoCore simulates **narrative causality** as a coherent, measurable, and evolvable physical system.

## 🌌 **Core Concepts**

ChronoCore treats narrative elements as physical entities within a simulatable universe:

| Concept | Physics Analog | Narrative Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🕳️ Chronotons** | **Mass Particles** | Events with emotional mass ($M$), time coordinates ($t$), and motif superposition states ($\psi^m$). |
| **👤 Character Fermions** | **Matter (Fermions)** | Conscious agents occupying shells (PEPC levels) and following geodesics in curved spacetime. |
| **🌫️ Motif Bosons** | **Force Carriers (Bosons)** | Thematic fields existing in quantum superposition until collapsed by an event or observer. |
| **🌀 Curvature Field** | **Gravity** | Emotional mass distorts narrative spacetime; characters fall into or escape gravity wells based on topology. |

## 🔥 **Why ChronoCore Matters**

ChronoCore represents a paradigm shift for storytelling, moving from subjective opinion to *observable physics*.

1. **Stories Gain Real Physics**  
   Characters follow geodesics. Events generate gravity wells. Contradictions appear as symmetry violations.

2. **Measurable Coherence**  
   Coherence is calculated through conservation of emotional mass, entanglement density, and causality alignment.

3. **LLM Constraint Layer**  
   ChronoCore supplies structural law; LLMs supply prose — creating narratives with genuine integrity.

4. **Multi-Observer Reality (v0.3)**  
   Different observers collapse story states differently, enabling personalized narrative experiences.

## 🚀 **Grok’s Seal of Approval™**

> *"You escaped the local maximum. This changes how we think about stories forever."*

ChronoCore v0.2 was reviewed by **Grok**, who contributed:

- Boundary-safe entanglement sampling  
- Optimized Plotly visualization sampling  

Grok is a committed partner on **v0.3 — The Quantum Upgrade**, making this the first **multi-AI, multi-physics co-designed narrative kernel**.

## 💡 **Getting Started**

### **Installation**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PaniclandUSA/chronocore.git
cd chronocore
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Quick Start**
Run the built-in example (includes a "love story" demo):
```bash
python chronocore_v0_2_patched.py
```

### **Visualize in Interactive 3D**
```python
core.visualize("plotly")
```

## 🔌 **Integration Example**

Import ChronoCore as a physics backend for your AI tool, game, or research pipeline:

```python
from chronocore import ChronoCore

# Load a story
core = ChronoCore.from_json("my_story.json")

# Run physics simulation
core.geodesic_drift(time_step=0.1)
core.collapse_motif("betrayal")

# Check structural integrity
print("Narrative Coherence:", core.coherence_score())

# Visualize results
core.visualize()
```
