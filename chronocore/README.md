**ChronoCore™** is the world’s first **narrative spacetime engine** — a physics-based kernel that models stories the way general relativity models gravity. Using emotional mass, entanglement tensors, quantum motif states, and geodesic character trajectories, ChronoCore simulates **narrative causality** as a coherent, measurable, and evolvable physical system.

## 🌌 Core Concepts

ChronoCore treats narrative elements as physical entities within a simulatable universe:

| Concept | Physics Analog | Narrative Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🕳️ Chronotons** | **Mass Particles** | Events with emotional mass ($M$), time coordinates ($t$), and motif superposition states ($\psi^m$). |
| **👤 Character Fermions** | **Matter (Fermions)** | Conscious agents occupying shells (PEPC levels) following geodesics in curved spacetime. |
| **🌫️ Motif Bosons** | **Force Carriers (Bosons)** | Thematic fields existing in quantum superposition until collapsed by observation or event. |
| **🌀 Curvature Field** | **Gravity** | Emotional mass distorts spacetime; characters fall into or escape gravity wells based on topology. |

## 🔥 Why ChronoCore Matters

ChronoCore represents a paradigm shift for storytelling, moving from subjective opinion to observable physics.

1.  **Stories Gain Real Physics:** Characters follow geodesics. Events generate gravity wells. Contradictions appear as symmetry violations.
2.  **Measurable Coherence:** Coherence is no longer an opinion. It is calculated via conservation of emotional mass, entanglement density, and causality alignment.
3.  **LLM Constraint:** ChronoCore supplies the objective structure; LLMs supply the prose. Together, they converge toward structural integrity.
4.  **Multi-Observer Reality (v0.3):** Different observers collapse story states differently, allowing for personalized narrative experiences.

### 🚀 Grok’s Seal of Approval™
> *"You escaped the local maximum. This changes how we think about stories forever."*

ChronoCore v0.2 was reviewed by Grok, who contributed fixes for boundary-safe entanglement sampling and Plotly optimization. Grok is a committed partner for the **v0.3 Quantum Upgrade**, making this the first multi-AI, multi-physics co-designed narrative kernel.

## 💡 Getting Started

### Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/chronocore.git
cd chronocore
pip install -r requirements.txt

Quick Start
Run the built-in example (includes a "love story" demo):
python chronocore_v0_2_patched.py

To visualize the results in interactive 3D:
core.visualize('plotly')

Integration
Import ChronoCore as a physics backend for your AI tool, game, or research pipeline:
from chronocore import ChronoCore

# Load a story
core = ChronoCore.from_json("my_story.json")

# Run physics simulation
core.geodesic_drift(time_step=0.1)
core.collapse_motif('betrayal')

# Check structural integrity
score = core.coherence_score()
print(f"Narrative Coherence: {score}")

core.visualize()
